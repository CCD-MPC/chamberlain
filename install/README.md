# Conclave-Web install README

This installation script assumes the following:

* You have an up to date installation of the OpenShift CLI:  https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases(tested with 3.11)

* You are currently logged into the OpenShift project in which you intend to deploy this system.

* You have a config file located at $HOME/.kube/config containing a valid token. 
This file is automatically generated upon installation of the OpenShift CLI, 
so it shouldn't be a problem.

* You have populated the configuration file at `/install/conf/conf.json`.

## Installation

If you wish to use Swift endpoints in conjunction with Conclave-Web, run:

```bash
python3 install_script.py
```

Else, run:

```bash
python3 install_script.py False
```

## Pending Implementation

* Conclave-Web currently pulls data from Swift by default, Dataverse integration is forthcoming.
